# GhostCar-FiveM
Ghost car halloween event from GTA Online made in FiveM

This is a fork of https://github.com/AlexR32/GhostCar-FiveM.
I made the script to work without the time check, now it works with commands:
- startCar (id) -- Spawn the car to a specified player.
- stopCar (id) -- Despawn the car to the specified player.
- startCarAll -- Spawn the car to ALL the players.
- stopCarAll -- Despawn the car to ALL the players.

This script require es_extended.
You can change the required group in the server.lua (replace "superadmin" with your group)
